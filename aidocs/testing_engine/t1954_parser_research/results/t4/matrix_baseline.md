Safety columns (must be 0): FP-writable, Docstring-write, Silent-uncertain, Record-corruption. Recall/cost: Missed-writable, Missed-comment (a plain comment line not classed Comment), Read-mismatch, Over-refusal, Placement. Fidelity and Behaviour count applied edits that changed other bytes / program behaviour. Definitions: the t1954 shared design, *Metrics*.
