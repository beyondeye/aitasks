Create a workflow guide explaining when and how to use aitask-wrap. Scenarios include: (1) developer made quick fixes directly without creating a task first, (2) exploratory changes during debugging that turned into real improvements, (3) config or dependency changes done outside the framework, (4) pair programming or live-coding sessions where changes accumulated without task tracking. The guide should clarify the relationship between aitask-wrap and the normal aitask-create workflow, and when each is appropriate.
