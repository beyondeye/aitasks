## Completed

Added explicit git commit steps to the aitask-pick skill's post-implementation section:

1. Added step 10 for child tasks: commit archived child task and plan files
2. Added step 8 for parent tasks: commit archived task and plan files

This ensures that archiving changes are properly tracked in version control.
