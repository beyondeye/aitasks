in the aitask_board python script it is already possible to move board columns with ctr+arrow. left / right, I would like the option rename a column, change its color and ADD a column.
aitasks/metadata/board_config.json

the board_config.json file already store information of the configured column, so editing and adding columns feature that is missing is only an issue of missing ui for these actions if I understand correclty. please verify and propose an ui for editing/adding columns to board. I don't want keybinding for these actions it is good enough to have them in the app command palette that opens with control+p
