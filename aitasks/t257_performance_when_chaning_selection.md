when I select a range of line with the keyboard or with the mouse or when use up and down arorows to scroll in a file, the movement are very slow while, while whene I scroll the file using the the side bar or the the mouse while it is very fast. are there inherent reasons why this happen? can we improve performance? do we have any related task already to address this issue?
