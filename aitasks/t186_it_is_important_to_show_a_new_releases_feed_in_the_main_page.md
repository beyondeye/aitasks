Task name (short, will be sanitized): It is important to show a new releases feed in the main page of the website, or perhaps better in the top menu, as "blog" entries with link to github full release notes and a main new features descriptions that summarize what changed. I don't if the creation of this blog entries should be automated with claude, I can probably do it manually? need to think about it perhaps define a custom command that is not exported to the release tarball that fetch the last release version release notes, create a "blog" entry in the hugo site (check docsy docs on how to do it) https://www.docsy.dev/docs/content/adding-content/ and ask the user what to change, the blog entry should written in "informal" language highlighting main feature with link to github full release motes
