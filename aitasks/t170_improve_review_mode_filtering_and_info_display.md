now reviewguides markdown files in aiscripts/metada/reviewguides contains significantly expanded metadata (reviewtype and reviewlabels): can use this information when showing available review mdoes to the user in the aitask_review guide skill (for a set of files that has been selected for reviews), it would be nices also to allow the user to filter review guides by review labels/ review types. that is currently the skill select a number of compatible reviewguide files and the user select one or more to apply. if the avaiable review guides are too many to show, we can ask the user to filter by review type /labels (multiple choice or direct entry that is matched by claude) and this will act as additional filter to select review guide to show to the users (Between available ones for detected "environment" for the files). ask me questions if you need clarifications
