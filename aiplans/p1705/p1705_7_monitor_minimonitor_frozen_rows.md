# t1705_7 — Frozen rows, counters, filter and keys in monitor + minimonitor

## Context

Surfaces the frozen state in both monitor TUIs and wires the user-facing
keys, following t1685's `parked` implementation site by site
(`aiplans/archived/p1685_park_code_agents_tristate_mark_and_visibility_toggle.md`
— read §4–§9 and the Final Implementation Notes first). Differences from
parked, all PINNED: the source of truth is the pane option `@aitask_frozen`
carried in the discovery row (t1705_4), not a marks pair, so there is no
publish-down; `frozen` **coexists** with the mark (row =
`<mark glyph><F> name  frozen`, mark glyph display-only, `space` still
cycles); every mutation shells out (`aitask_frozen.sh` via the maintenance
subprocess seam, restore/re-pick via `run-shell -b`); the maintenance tick
gains a sessions purge + reconcile twin.

Live parts are tmux-stress — exercise them on an isolated server.

## Implementation steps

1. **Core.** `ClassifyResult.frozen: bool = False` with the parked-style
   docstring; `PaneSnapshot.frozen: bool = False`, `frozen_record_id: str = ""`;
   `_frozen_snapshot(pane, now)` = `PaneSnapshot(pane, content="", timestamp=now,
   idle_seconds=0.0, is_idle=False, awaiting_input=False, frozen=True,
   frozen_record_id=pane.frozen_record)` built outside `_apply_bookkeeping`.
   In `capture_all_classified_async`, after `_record_discovery_facts` and
   after the parked split: `frozen_panes = [p for p in rest if self._is_frozen_pane(p)]`,
   removed from the capture set, re-joined as
   `(pane, None, ClassifyResult(compare_value="", frozen=True))`; shadows
   never filtered. `commit_snapshots`: `if result is not None and result.frozen:
   snapshots[pid] = _frozen_snapshot(pane, now); continue` placed before the
   `result is None` drop. Discovery survival: frozen panes stay in
   `last_discovered_agents()` (they are real agent slots for liveness).
2. **Glyph.** `FROZEN_GLYPH = "F"` under `PARK_GLYPH` with the same
   measurement note (U+0046: both families, not emoji-capable — run the
   generator, commit the JSON diff); `format_frozen_prefix(kind: str) -> str`
   = `format_mark_glyph(kind) + f"[bold cyan]{FROZEN_GLYPH}[/]"`
   (`format_mark_glyph` still raises on unknown kinds — do **not** add a
   frozen kind to `agent_marks`). Extend `test_mark_glyphs_single_source.py`
   with `test_the_frozen_glyph_evidence_is_recorded` and
   `test_monitor_agent_marks.py` with distinctness against `● ★ ☆ P F`.
3. **Mixin.** `_hide_frozen = False` class floor + `_init_agent_marks`;
   `_is_frozen(snap)`; `action_toggle_frozen_visibility` mirroring
   `action_toggle_parked_visibility` (:780-796) incl. `_hand_off_focus_before_hiding`;
   `_run_frozen_cmd(argv)` = `_run_marks_cmd` pointed at `aitask_frozen.sh`
   (same timeout, same total-by-contract shape); `_maybe_purge_sessions()`
   = copy of `_maybe_purge_marks()` with its own inflight flag, writing the
   observation file with `panes=self._monitor.last_discovered_panes()` and
   running `aitask_agent_sessions.sh purge --observed <f>` then
   `aitask_frozen.sh reconcile`, dispatched from
   `_dispatch_refresh_maintenance` (:455-490) under the same
   `_MARKS_PURGE_STARTUP_GRACE`; `_write_observation_file(observed, roots,
   complete, panes=None)` emits `PANE` rows after `WINDOW` rows when given.
4. **Rows + partition (both apps).** Minimonitor row: `if snap.frozen:
   return f"{format_frozen_prefix(self._mark_kind(snap))} {name}  [dim]frozen[/]"`
   placed **before** the parked branch (frozen wins); monitor row likewise
   with the `window_index:window_name (pane_index)` shape. Filters:
   `if self._hide_frozen and s.frozen: continue` beside the parked line.
   Every "leaves the partition" site from the file list: treat `frozen`
   exactly as `parked` (`live = [a for a in agents if not a.parked and not
   a.frozen]`); session-bar terms `frozen_str = f" [dim]{n}f[/]"` after
   `parked_str` (minimonitor) and `"  N frozen"` after `N parked`
   (monitor), both independent of `_hide_frozen`. Preview placeholder text:
   `This agent is frozen — press R to restore or p to re-pick.`
5. **Keys.** First grep both apps' `BINDINGS` for `z`, `Z`, `F`, `R`; if
   any collides, pick the next free letter and record the choice in the
   Final Implementation Notes and for t1705_9. Minimonitor: `Binding("z",
   "freeze_own", "Freeze followed agent", show=False)`, `Binding("Z",
   "freeze_all", "Freeze all agents", show=False)`, `Binding("F",
   "toggle_frozen_visibility", "Frozen", show=False)`, `Binding("R",
   "restore_focused", "Restore frozen", show=False)`; `p` keeps
   `pick_task` but `action_pick_task` first checks `snap = self._focused_snapshot()`
   and, when `snap.frozen`, routes to `_repick_frozen(snap)` (guard in the
   **action**, not the binding); `k` on the followed agent when it is
   frozen → `KillConfirmDialog` text "Remove frozen record and capture, close
   this pane?" → `aitask_agent_sessions.sh drop` + `kill_agent_pane_smart`.
   `action_freeze_own`: resolve the followed agent
   (`_find_own_agent_snapshot`), confirm dialog ("Freeze <window>? The
   process ends; its output is kept and it can be restored."), then
   `_run_frozen_cmd(["freeze", pane_id])` → `notify` the wire line; on
   `FREEZE_FAILED:` show it as warning. `action_freeze_all`: confirm with
   the count of live agents, `_run_frozen_cmd(["freeze", "--all"])`,
   notify `<ok>/<total>`. `action_restore_focused` /
   `_repick_frozen`: `self._tmux.run(["run-shell", "-b", shlex.join([FROZEN_SH, "restore", id, *(["--repick"] if repick else [])])])`
   then `_restore_feedback_poll(id)` (1 s `set_interval`, bounded by
   `restore_ack_grace + 5`, notifies the outcome line, stops on any
   terminal state). Monitor: same actions on the focused card, `Z`/`F`
   `show=True` in the Footer. `KEY_HINTS_TEXT`: fold `z:freeze F:frozen`
   onto the `c:concerns  p:pick task  P:parked` line if it stays ≤ 38 cells;
   otherwise onto the line with the most room — **ten rows** either way;
   `_KEY_HINTS_ROWS` derived; `test_key_hints_surface_every_binding` and
   `test_minimonitor_top_chrome_render` must stay green.
6. **Own panel (minimonitor).** In `_refresh_own_live_state`, when the own
   snapshot is frozen: `F frozen <frozen_at>` (frozen_at from
   `SessionsView().by_id(snap.frozen_record_id)`), no phase line, `n` still
   offered; `_parked_agent_pairs()` unchanged (parked is orthogonal).
7. **Doubles.** Complete every `SimpleNamespace` snapshot double t1685
   listed (`tests/test_multi_session_{monitor,minimonitor}.sh` and the five
   Python modules it names) with the two new fields.

## Tests

`tests/test_monitor_frozen_capture.py` — mirror `test_monitor_parked_capture.py`
class for class: a frozen pane is never in `capture_pane_content_async`'s
args nor in `classify_content` calls (recorded seams + negative control:
patch `_is_frozen_pane` to `False` and assert it *is* captured); commits a
`frozen=True, content=""` snapshot whose `frozen_record_id` is the option
value; `_last_content` untouched; still in `last_discovered_agents()`; only
AGENT panes; shadows never filtered; `_frozen_snapshot` bypasses
`_apply_bookkeeping`.
`tests/test_monitor_frozen_filter.py` — mirror `test_monitor_parked_filter.py`:
row render for `KIND_NONE` / priority / parked marks (`☆F`, `★F`, `PF` +
`frozen`), forbids `● ◆ ≈ = IDLE PROMPT Active` (positive control on a live
row); mounted row; `F` bound once in both apps, no collision; hint row
contains `z:` and `F:` and stays ten rows; focus handoff next/prev/single;
preview placeholder; session-bar partition (frozen leaves every live
bucket, term present, absent at zero, filter-independent); auto-switch
never picks frozen; actions: `z` produces `["freeze", pane]`, `Z`
`["freeze","--all"]`, `R` the exact `run-shell -b` argv, `p` on a frozen
row → `--repick` argv and on a live row → the existing pick dialog, `k` on
frozen → `drop` then kill, `space` on a frozen row still cycles the mark
(store double asserts `cycle` called); own-panel frozen render;
`_maybe_purge_sessions` dispatched after the grace with `PANE` rows in the
observation file and never awaited (assert on `_dispatch_refresh_maintenance`
like `RefreshOrderingTests`).

## Verification

# live, on an isolated server or a throwaway -L socket: ./ait minimonitor, z, F, R, k on a frozen row
```

## PINNED contracts (from p1705 — do not re-decide)

Copied verbatim from `aiplans/p1705_frozen_codeagents_session_store_and_viewer_tui.md` §A–§D. On any discrepancy the parent plan wins; if a child must deviate, update the parent plan and every sibling plan in the same commit.


#### A. Session store — `lib/agent_sessions.py` + `aitask_agent_sessions.sh`

- Path `~/.config/aitasks/agent_sessions.json`, env override
  `AITASKS_AGENT_SESSIONS_FILE`, lock dir derived from the resolved path
  (`<file>.lockd`), 0600 with `_target_mode` preservation, write via
  `lib/atomic_write.py`. Captures under `~/.config/aitasks/frozen/<id>/`
  (0700 dir; `capture.ansi`, `capture.txt`), env `AITASKS_FROZEN_DIR`.
- Schema v1:
  ```json
  {"version": 1, "sessions": [{
    "id": "7f3a2c1d",                 // record id (8 hex, os.urandom) — PRIMARY KEY
    "root": "/real/path/project",     // realpath, both sides         ┐ DURABLE IDENTITY
    "window": "agent-pick-1705",      //                               │ (root, window, window_slot)
    "window_slot": 0,                 // assigned once; >0 only for a 2nd agent in the same window ┘
    "pane_id": "%104", "pane_pid": 41233,   // LOCATION / GENERATION data — replaceable, never identity
    "session": "aitasks",             // tmux session name — display only
    "operation": "pick", "task_id": "1705",          // task_id "" when unbound
    "agent_string": "claudecode/opus5", "agent_kind": "claudecode",
    "codeagent_session_id": "", "transcript_path": "",  // "" = unknown → re-pick only
    "started_at": "2026-09-04T09:12:03Z",
    "state": "live",                  // live | freezing | frozen | restoring | aborting
    "state_at": "2026-09-04T09:12:03Z",
    "op_nonce": "", "op_owner_pid": 0, "op_started_at": "",   // LEASE of the in-flight freeze/restore (see below)
    "frozen_at": "", "capture_ansi": "", "capture_txt": "",
    "capture_lines": 0, "last_phase": "",
    "standin_pid": 0,                 // #{pane_pid} of the stand-in viewer, written at freeze-commit and every stand-in respawn
    "launch_pid": 0,                  // #{pane_pid} of the replacement agent, written by restore-launched (nonce-bound)
    "restore_attempts": 0, "restore_mode": "",   // "" | resume | repick (current attempt)
    "ack": "",                        // "" | hook | liveness — how the last restore was confirmed
    "last_error": ""                  // "" | "<nonce>:session_mismatch" | "<nonce>:<reason>" — coordinator-readable outcome channel
  }]}
  ```
  `pane_id` / `pane_pid` are **location and generation data**: a tmux server
  restart, a reattach or a respawn replaces them on the same record. They
  are never part of the identity key and a recycled `%N` can attach to
  nothing on its own — attachment needs either `@aitask_record` on the pane
  (options die with the pane, so a recycled pane never carries a stale one)
  or a `(root, window)` match under the conflict policy below.
  Unknown `state` = corruption (not a default). `load()` raises
  `MalformedSessionsError`; `load_safe()` returns empty. Generation normalised
  to `SCHEMA_VERSION` on read.
- **Record ownership (one allocator) and the `(root, window)` conflict
  policy.** The `upsert` verb is the *only* creator of records. Resolution
  order for a caller without `--restore-of`:
  1. `--id <rid>` (from `@aitask_record` on the caller's pane) → that record,
     whatever its `(root, window)` (a renamed window keeps its record).
  2. Else, **among `live` records only** with the caller's `(root, window)`,
     the relocation candidates are: the one whose `pane_id` equals the
     caller's pane, else those whose `pane_pid` is dead or whose pane no
     longer exists. **Exactly one candidate** → it is the same agent slot:
     replace `pane_id`/`pane_pid`, update session id / transcript / agent
     string, print `UPSERTED:<id>|updated` (the tmux-restart and reattach
     case — no second record). **More than one candidate** (two agents shared
     the window before a server restart; nothing on the caller's side can
     tell them apart) → **fail closed on relocation**: fall through to rule 3
     and print `UPSERTED:<id>|created_slot<N>|ambiguous_relocation`; the stale
     records are left for purge (rule: a `live` record whose `pane_pid` is
     dead and whose `pane_id` is absent from an enumerated window →
     `DROPPED:…|dead_pane`), never guessed.
     Transitional records (`freezing`/`restoring`/`aborting`) are **never**
     relocated or updated by an unstamped caller: they are touched only by
     `--restore-of` + the current nonce, or by `reconcile`. If the caller's
     pane *is* a transitional record's pane → refuse
     (`UPSERT_REFUSED:<id>|<state>_unacknowledged`, a stray session in a
     transacting pane); otherwise they are simply not candidates.
  3. Else every `(root, window)` record is `live` in **another** pane (a
     second agent split into the same window), transitional, or `frozen`
     (retained state whose window name is being reused, e.g. the same task
     re-picked after a tmux restart) → **create beside it**: new record,
     `window_slot` = lowest unused slot for that `(root, window)`, print
     `UPSERTED:<id>|created_slot<N>`. A retained frozen record never blocks a
     live launch and is never attached to; it stays restorable into a fresh
     window (`unique_window_name` disambiguates) and is listed distinctly by
     its `frozen_at`.
  4. Else → create (`state=live`, `window_slot=0`), print `UPSERTED:<id>|created`.
  In every create/update branch the caller's pane is stamped
  `@aitask_record=<id>`.
  Other branches:
  - record exists in `restoring` **and** the caller passes
    `--restore-of <id> --nonce <n>` (the hook forwards them from the
    replacement agent's environment, §D) → the **restore acknowledgement**:
    nonce must equal `op_nonce`; in `resume` mode `--session-id` must equal
    `codeagent_session_id` — else the store **persists**
    `last_error="<nonce>:session_mismatch"` (state unchanged) and prints
    `RESTORE_SESSION_MISMATCH:<id>` exit 7. The hook has no return channel to
    the detached coordinator, so the record *is* the channel: the coordinator
    and `reconcile` both read `last_error` for the current nonce and take the
    abort branch, never the liveness fallback. In `repick` mode the new
    session id is adopted. On success: `pane_id`/`pane_pid` updated from the
    caller's pane, `@aitask_record` stamped on it, state `live`, `ack=hook`,
    capture files deleted, print `UPSERTED:<id>|restored`;
  - record exists in `restoring` without `--restore-of`/`--nonce` → refuse,
    print `UPSERT_REFUSED:<id>|restoring_unacknowledged` (a stray session in
    a restoring pane is never an ack);
  - record exists in `freezing` / `frozen` → refuse, print
    `UPSERT_REFUSED:<id>|<state>` (a hook firing in a stand-in pane is a bug).
  Two callers: the SessionStart hook (child 3, normal path) and the freeze
  engine (child 4, fallback when the hook never fired). Both read
  `@aitask_record` off the pane first and pass `--id` when present, so a pane
  that was already recorded is never duplicated even after a `pane_id`
  recycle. A restore into a **new** pane (window gone) carries the record id
  in the environment, never on the pane, so it selects the old record instead
  of creating a second one.
- **Operation lease.** `freeze-begin`, `restore-begin` and `lease-take` mint
  `op_nonce` (8 hex), record `op_owner_pid` (the coordinator) and
  `op_started_at`, and print the nonce. **Every verb that mutates a record
  holding a lease** (`freeze-commit`, `freeze-abort`, `restore-launched`,
  `restore-confirm`, `restore-abort`, `standin-respawned`, the ack form of
  `upsert`) requires `--nonce <n>`; a mismatch prints `NONCE_MISMATCH:<id>`
  exit 6 and writes nothing — a coordinator that lost the race to
  `reconcile` fails closed instead of double-acting. `lease-take <id>` →
  `LEASED:<id>|<nonce>` is how `reconcile` (or a stand-in relaunch on a
  `frozen` record) acquires ownership: it is refused (`LEASE_HELD:<id>`)
  while a lease exists whose `op_started_at` is younger than
  `stale_op_grace` (default 60 s) **or** whose `op_owner_pid` is alive; a
  stale lease with a dead/unverifiable owner is taken over. Within the grace,
  or with a live owner, reconcile leaves the record alone. Lease-clearing
  transitions (`freeze-commit`, `freeze-abort`, `restore-confirm`, hook ack,
  `standin-respawned` out of `aborting`) clear the lease.
- **State machine** (every transition is one locked verb; illegal transitions
  print `TRANSITION_REFUSED:<id>|<from>|<verb>` exit 5 and write nothing):
  ```
  live ──freeze-begin──▶ freezing ──freeze-commit──▶ frozen ◀────────────────┐
   ▲                        │                          │                      │
   └────freeze-abort────────┘                          │ restore-begin        │ standin-respawned
   ▲                                                   ▼                      │ (same nonce)
   └──upsert (hook ack) / restore-confirm── restoring ──restore-abort──▶ aborting
  drop: any state → record removed + capture files removed
  ```
  `aborting` is **nonce-owned**: the record stays leased by the aborting
  attempt until its stand-in is back (`standin-respawned --nonce` → `frozen`,
  lease cleared). `restore-begin` on `aborting` → `TRANSITION_REFUSED`, so a
  user or a second controller cannot start another restore in the gap and
  an old coordinator cannot respawn over a newer attempt: its `standin-respawned`
  carries a stale nonce and is refused.
  **Captures are deleted only on a verified ack** (`ack=hook`). A
  liveness-only `restore-confirm` transitions to `live` but **keeps** the
  capture files (`ack=liveness`); they are removed on `drop` or liveness
  purge. This is what stops a malformed resume that starts a fresh session
  from destroying the only copy.

  `restore-confirm <id> --nonce <n> --pane <id> --pane-pid <pid>` → `LIVE:<id>|liveness` (captures **kept**; refused with `TRANSITION_REFUSED` unless `launch_pid != 0` and equals `--pane-pid`);
  `standin-respawned <id> --nonce <n> --pane <id> --pane-pid <pid>` → `STANDIN:<id>` (records the stand-in's `standin_pid` + location; from `aborting` it also transitions to `frozen` and clears the lease; from `frozen` (a `lease-take`n relaunch of a dead stand-in) it just updates and clears the lease; `freeze-commit` folds the same write in);

  ```
  `monitor_shared._write_observation_file()` gains a `panes=` argument and
  writes the `PANE` rows from `TmuxMonitor.last_discovered_panes()` (the
  `_LIST_PANES_FORMAT` already carries `pane_id` and `pane_pid`; `pane_dead`
  is appended to the format — see §B arity rule). The marks reader
  (`agent_marks._read_observed`) is extended to **skip** `PANE` rows so one
  file serves both purges; `agent_sessions` requires them. A file with
  `ROOT`/`WINDOW` but no `PANE` rows for an enumerated root is treated as
  pane-incomplete for that root: `dead_window` still applies, `dead_pane`
  does not (fail closed).
- **Purge policy** (fail-closed on `INCOMPLETE`, mirrors `sweep_liveness`):
  a `live` record whose `(root, window)` is absent from a successfully
  enumerated root → `DROPPED:…|dead_window`; a `live` record whose window has
  a `WINDOW` row **and** `PANE` rows, but whose `pane_id` appears in none of
  them (or appears with `pane_dead=1`) and whose `pane_pid` is dead
  (`os.kill(pid, 0)` → `ESRCH`; an `EPERM`/unverifiable pid is treated as
  alive) → `DROPPED:…|dead_pane` — this is what retires the stale candidates
  left behind by an ambiguous relocation. Two producers feed `purge`: the
  monitor maintenance tick (observation file above) and `aitask_frozen.sh
  reconcile`, which builds the same file from its own `list-panes` pass so
  retirement does not depend on a TUI being open. `freezing` / `frozen` / `restoring` /
  `aborting` records are never purged by liveness — they are reconciled by
  `aitask_frozen.sh reconcile` (§C/§D). A frozen record whose capture file is
  missing → `DROPPED:…|capture_missing`.
- `SessionsView` (mtime+size+inode gated) for the TUIs; `invalidate()` after
  every write. `standin_command(record_id) -> str` returns
  `ait frozenagent --record <id>` unless `AITASKS_FROZEN_STANDIN_CMD` is set
  (documented **test seam**; production never sets it).

#### B. Pane options (tmux user options, pane-scoped)

| Option | Set by | Cleared by | Read by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `@aitask_record=<id>` | `upsert` (hook or freeze engine) | `drop`; pane death | freeze engine, restore coordinator, hook (`--id`) | the pane-visible join to its store record |
| `@aitask_frozen=<id>` | freeze engine, immediately before `respawn-pane` | `restore-confirm` path (coordinator), `drop` | `_LIST_PANES_FORMAT` (appended), `kill_agent_pane_smart` format, `aitask_companion_cleanup.sh`, `maybe_spawn_minimonitor` occupancy | this pane is a frozen stand-in — **authoritative** classifier |
| `@aitask_standin_ready=<id>` | **the viewer itself**, after mount (only the app stamps its own pane — `mark_monitor_pane` rule) | freeze engine + restore coordinator (`set-option -pu`) immediately **before** every `respawn-pane`; `drop` | `reconcile` | positive proof that the stand-in is up — the only signal that distinguishes "stamped, viewer running" from "stamped, agent still running" |
| `@aitask_agent_session=<sid>` | SessionStart hook on `$TMUX_PANE` | pane death | freeze engine fallback when the store has no session id | codeagent session id |

**Pane user options survive `respawn-pane`** (they are pane-scoped, not
process-scoped), which is why `@aitask_standin_ready` must be explicitly unset
before each respawn and why `@aitask_record` stays valid across freeze/restore
on the same pane. `#{pane_current_command}` is a process basename and is
**never** used as identity; `#{pane_pid}` (stored as `pane_pid`) and the
options above are the only server-observable identities reconcile reads.

Constants live in `monitor/monitor_core.py` beside `SHADOW_TARGET_OPTION`
(`RECORD_OPTION`, `FROZEN_OPTION`, `STANDIN_READY_OPTION`,
`AGENT_SESSION_OPTION`) and are mirrored in `lib/agent_sessions.sh` for shell
callers.

#### C. Freeze — `lib/agent_freeze.py` + `aitask_frozen.sh freeze <pane>|--all`

Runs **out of the agent pane** (from a TUI, a shell, or `run-shell -b`).
Every step is persisted before the next irreversible one:

1. Resolve the record: `@aitask_record` → `show`; else `upsert` (fallback).
   Read `codeagent_session_id`; if empty, try `@aitask_agent_session`.
2. `capture-pane -p -e -J -t <pane> -S -<cap>` via `TmuxClient.run` →
   `capture.ansi`; strip via `monitor/ansi_utils` → `capture.txt`.
3. `freeze-begin` → state `freezing`, capture paths persisted, **lease
   minted** (`op_nonce`, `op_owner_pid`=this coordinator).
4. `set-option -p -t <pane> @aitask_frozen <id>`; `set-option -pu -t <pane>
   @aitask_standin_ready` (clear any stale ready mark from a previous cycle).
5. `respawn-pane -k -t <pane> '<standin_command(id)>'` via the gateway.
   Window name unchanged, so `classify_pane` / `task_id_from_window_name`
   keep working. The viewer stamps `@aitask_standin_ready=<id>` on mount.
6. `freeze-commit --nonce <n> --pane <pane> --pane-pid <stand-in pid>` →
   state `frozen`, `standin_pid` + location recorded (read via
   `display-message -p -t <pane> '#{pane_id}\t#{pane_pid}'` after the
   respawn), lease cleared.

Failure at 1–3 → nothing to undo beyond temp files (`FREEZE_FAILED:<stage>`).
Failure at 4 → `freeze-abort --nonce`. Failure at 5 (tmux refused) → unstamp +
`freeze-abort --nonce`; the agent is still running. Failure at 6 (store busy)
→ the record stays `freezing`; **reconcile** completes it once the lease is
stale. A `NONCE_MISMATCH` at 6 means reconcile already resolved the record;
the coordinator reports it and exits without touching the pane.

**`aitask_frozen.sh reconcile`** (idempotent; run by the coordinator after
every freeze/restore, by the monitor maintenance tick beside
`_maybe_purge_marks`, and manually) resolves every non-`live` record **whose
lease is stale** (`op_started_at` + `stale_op_grace` elapsed **and**
`op_owner_pid` dead/unverifiable — otherwise the record is skipped as
in-flight) from server-observable facts only
(`list-panes -F '#{pane_id}\t#{pane_pid}\t#{pane_dead}\t#{@aitask_frozen}\t#{@aitask_standin_ready}\t#{@aitask_record}'`;
"agent alive" = `pane_pid == record.pane_pid`; "viewer here" =
`pane_pid == record.standin_pid`; "replacement here" =
`pane_pid == record.launch_pid`; "stand-in up" = `@aitask_standin_ready == id`;
"mismatch" = `last_error` begins with the current `op_nonce`):

| record state | pane observation | action |
|---|---|---|
| `freezing` | `@aitask_frozen==id` **and** stand-in up | `freeze-commit --pane <pane> --pane-pid <observed pid>` |
| `freezing` | agent alive, stand-in not up | unstamp both options, `freeze-abort` (captures deleted) |
| `freezing` | `@aitask_frozen==id`, stand-in not up, neither agent nor viewer pid, pane not dead | **indeterminate — no transition** (viewer may still be booting); re-checked next pass |
| `freezing` | `@aitask_frozen==id`, pane dead | respawn the stand-in (clear ready first), `standin-respawned`, then re-check |
| `freezing` | pane gone | `freeze-commit --pane "" --pane-pid 0` |
| `frozen` | pane gone | keep (restorable into a new window) |
| `frozen` | `@aitask_frozen==id`, pane dead | `lease-take`, respawn the stand-in, `standin-respawned --nonce` |
| `restoring` | mismatch recorded for this nonce | `restore-abort` (→ `aborting`), kill the wrong agent via `respawn-pane -k` back to the stand-in, `standin-respawned --nonce` (→ `frozen`) — **never** liveness-confirm |
| `restoring` | viewer here (`pane_pid==standin_pid`) — the coordinator died before or during the respawn, whether or not the ready mark survived | `restore-abort`; respawn the stand-in so it re-stamps ready; `standin-respawned --nonce` |
| `restoring` | `launch_pid==0` and pane pid is neither the viewer's nor the agent's | **indeterminate — no transition** (respawn may be mid-flight); after `stale_op_grace` ×2 → `restore-abort` + respawn stand-in + `standin-respawned --nonce` |
| `restoring` | replacement here (`pane_pid==launch_pid`), pane not dead, no mismatch, `state_at` + `restore_ack_grace` (default 20 s) elapsed | `restore-confirm --pane --pane-pid` (`ack=liveness`, captures kept) |
| `restoring` | pane dead | `restore-abort`, clear ready, respawn the stand-in, `standin-respawned --nonce` |
| `restoring` | pane gone | `restore-abort` with `pane_id=""`, then `standin-respawned --nonce --pane "" --pane-pid 0` (→ `frozen`, restorable into a new window) |
| `aborting` (stale lease taken over) | stand-in up (`@aitask_standin_ready==id`) | `standin-respawned --nonce` (→ `frozen`) |
| `aborting` (stale lease taken over) | anything else | clear ready, respawn the stand-in, `standin-respawned --nonce` (→ `frozen`) |

Every reconcile action on a leased record is preceded by `lease-take`; a
`LEASE_HELD` answer means a live coordinator owns it and reconcile skips.

A liveness confirm therefore requires **positive evidence** that the
process in the pane is the one the coordinator launched (`launch_pid`), and
a viewer whose ready mark was cleared is still recognised by `standin_pid`.

Failure injection: `AITASKS_FREEZE_FAIL_AT=capture|begin|stamp|respawn|commit`,
`AITASKS_RESTORE_FAIL_AT=begin|respawn|ack`, and `AITASKS_FROZEN_PAUSE_AT=<stage>`
(the coordinator `SIGSTOP`s itself so a test can run a concurrent
`reconcile` and then `SIGCONT`) — documented test seams, honoured only under
`AITASKS_TEST_MODE=1`.

**Cleanup contract** (`aitask_companion_cleanup.sh` + `count_other_real_agents`
must agree — pinned by the parity test):
- a `@aitask_frozen`-stamped pane **counts as a real agent sibling** (the
  window exists to hold it; killing agent B must not destroy frozen A's viewer);
- when the *dying* pane is the stamped one, the cleanup script **abstains
  entirely** (it is being respawned, not departing);
- `kill_agent_pane_smart` on a frozen pane = `drop` + kill by the same rule.

#### D. Restore — `lib/agent_restore.py` + `aitask_frozen.sh restore <id> [--repick] | --all`

**Never runs inside the pane it replaces.** The viewer's `R`/`p` keys and the
minimonitor keys invoke `run-shell -b "<repo>/.aitask-scripts/aitask_frozen.sh restore <id>"`
through the gateway; the coordinator is a detached process that outlives the
respawn. Two-phase, acknowledged:

1. Build the argv: `aitask_codeagent.sh --agent-string <s> --resume-session <sid> --dry-run invoke raw`
   (resume) or the existing pick launch argv (`--repick`, task id required).
   Empty session id and no `--repick` → `RESTORE_FAILED:no_session` (nothing changes).
2. `restore-begin --mode <m>` → state `restoring`, lease minted (nonce `n`);
   captures and `@aitask_frozen` retained.
3. Prefix the argv with the **restore identity environment** (the
   `explore-relay` `env` precedent — `env` execs into the agent, so the pane
   pid is still the agent's):
   `env AITASK_RESTORE_RECORD=<id> AITASK_RESTORE_NONCE=<n> AITASK_RESTORE_MODE=<m> AITASK_RESTORE_EXPECT_SESSION=<sid> <argv>`.
   Then `set-option -pu @aitask_standin_ready` and
   `respawn-pane -k -t <stand-in> '<env argv>'` — or, when `pane_id=""`,
   `launch_in_tmux` into a new window with the recorded name. Immediately
   after tmux returns, read the new `#{pane_pid}` and write
   `restore-launched --nonce --pane --pane-pid` — the nonce-bound evidence
   that a replacement was actually started. The replacement agent's
   SessionStart hook forwards the four variables as `upsert --restore-of
   --nonce --session-id` (§A ack rules), which is what selects the **old**
   record from a brand-new pane, verifies the resumed session id, and stamps
   `@aitask_record` there.
4. Wait for the ack: poll `show <id>` until `state=live`, `last_error`
   carries this nonce, **or** `restore_ack_grace` elapses.
   - `live` with `ack=hook` → clear `@aitask_frozen`, print `RESTORED:<id>|hook`
     (captures already deleted by the ack).
   - `last_error="<nonce>:session_mismatch"` (the hook reported a different
     session in `resume` mode; persisted by the store because the hook has
     no channel to this process) → `restore-abort --nonce` (→ `aborting`,
     still owned by this nonce), `set-option -pu @aitask_standin_ready`,
     `respawn-pane -k` back to the stand-in, then `standin-respawned --nonce
     --pane --pane-pid` (→ `frozen`), print `RESTORE_FAILED:<id>|session_mismatch`;
     **capture intact**. The same abort → respawn → `standin-respawned --nonce`
     sequence is used by every failure branch below; a `NONCE_MISMATCH` at
     any step means reconcile already finished the abort.
   - grace elapsed, pane alive, `pane_pid == launch_pid`, no hook ack and no
     error → `restore-confirm --nonce --pane --pane-pid` → `live` with
     `ack=liveness`, **captures kept**, clear the stamp, print
     `RESTORED:<id>|liveness` (the viewer/minimonitor show "restored,
     unverified — capture kept").
   - pane dead at any poll (invalid session, binary missing, immediate exit)
     → `restore-abort --nonce`, clear ready, respawn the stand-in,
     `standin-respawned --nonce`, print `RESTORE_FAILED:<id>|agent_exited` —
     **the capture is intact and the viewer is back**.
   - `NONCE_MISMATCH` on any verb → reconcile already settled it; exit
     without touching the pane.
5. Coordinator crash between 2 and 4 → `reconcile` (§C table) settles it
   once the lease is stale.

`aitask_codeagent.sh` gains a global `--resume-session <sid>` (template
`OPT_HEADLESS`): `claude --model <id> --resume <sid>`, `codex resume <sid>`
(model flag per codex CLI), opencode → `RESUME_UNSUPPORTED:opencode` exit 2.
Resolution stays single-sourced in `lib/agent_string.sh`. Restore-All iterates
`frozen` records; per-record failures are reported, never abort the batch.
