[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-website-blue)](https://beyondeye.github.io/aitasks/)

AI-powered task management framework for Claude Code projects.

A file-based task management system that integrates with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) via skills. Tasks are markdown files with YAML frontmatter, organized in a kanban-style workflow. Includes a Python TUI board, GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket issue integration, and completion statistics.

Built for maximizing development speed 🚀 AND human-to-agent intent transfer efficiency 💬.

Inspired by [Conductor](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor), and [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)

## The challenge
AI coding agents has reached a proficiency level where, given correct specs and intent, are almost always capable of handling a code-development task. The challenge is the transfer of intent from developer/designer to the AI agent. The challenge is two-fold:
  1) Transfer intent in a structured way that optimize context building for the AI agent
  2) Maximize speed so that the human in the loop does not become the bottle-neck for development speed

## Core Philosophy
"Light Spec" engine: Unlike rigid Spec-Driven Development (e.g., [Speckit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), tasks here are living documents:
  - Raw Intent: A task starts as a simple Markdown file capturing the goal.
  - Iterative Refinement: An included AI workflow refines task files in stages—expanding context, adding technical details, and verifying requirements—before code is written.

## Key Features & Architecture
- Repository-Centric (Inspired by Conductor)
  - Tasks as Files: Every task is a Markdown file stored within the code repository.

  - Self-Contained Metadata: Unlike Conductor, task metadata (status, priority, assignee) is stored directly in the file's YAML frontmatter.

- Daemon-less & Stateless (The Beads Evolution) No Infrastructure: No SQL backend, no background daemons. Just files and scripts.

- Remote-Ready: Because the state is entirely in the file system, it works seamlessly in remote AI-agent sessions.

- Dual-Mode CLI tools optimized for two distinct users:
  - Interactive Mode (For Humans): Optimized for "Flow." Rapidly create, edit, and prioritize tasks without context switching.
  - Batch Mode (For Agents): allowing AI agents to read specs, create tasks and update task status programmatically.

- Hierarchical Execution
  - Task Dependencies: Define task/task and task parent/task child relationships.

  - Agent Decomposition: If a task is too risky or complex for a single run, the Agent can "explode" a parent task into child files.

  - Parallelism: thanks to task status stored in git, and AI agents workflow that support git worktrees.

- Visual Management
TUI Board: A terminal-based visual interface (Kanban style) for visualizing and organizing tasks without leaving the terminal. See the [Board Documentation](https://beyondeye.github.io/aitasks/docs/board/) for full details.

- Battle tested:
Not a research experiment. actively developed and used in real projects

- Claude Code optimized.

- Fully customizable workflow for each project:  all the scripts and workflow skills live in you project repo: modify it for your needs. You will still be able to merge new features and cabilities as they are added to the framework, with the included AI agent-based framework update skill.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Arch Linux | Fully supported | Primary development platform |
| Ubuntu/Debian | Fully supported | Includes Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, Elementary |
| Fedora/RHEL | Fully supported | Includes CentOS, Rocky, Alma |
| macOS | Partial | `date -d` and bash 3.2 limitations (see [Known Issues](#known-issues)) |
| Windows (WSL) | Fully supported | Via WSL with Ubuntu/Debian (see [Windows guide](https://beyondeye.github.io/aitasks/docs/installation/windows-wsl/)) |

## Known Issues

- **macOS `date -d`**: The `ait stats` and `ait issue-import` commands use GNU `date -d` which is not available with macOS BSD date. Install `coreutils` via Homebrew (`brew install coreutils`) to get `gdate` as a workaround.
- **macOS bash**: The system bash on macOS is v3.2; aitasks requires bash 4+. Running `ait setup` on macOS installs bash 5 via Homebrew.

## Quick Install

Install into your project directory:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beyondeye/aitasks/main/install.sh | bash
```

> **Windows users:** Run this inside a WSL shell, not PowerShell. See the [Windows/WSL guide](https://beyondeye.github.io/aitasks/docs/installation/windows-wsl/).

Upgrade an existing installation:

```bash
ait install latest
```

Or for fresh installs without an existing `ait` dispatcher:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beyondeye/aitasks/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --force
```

After installing, restart your shell (or run `source ~/.zshrc`) so the global `ait` shim is available, then run `ait setup` to install dependencies and configure Claude Code permissions. Alternatively, run `./ait setup` immediately without restarting. See [`ait setup`](https://beyondeye.github.io/aitasks/docs/commands/setup-install/) for details.

**Already have the global `ait` shim?** If you've previously run `ait setup` on another project, the global shim at `~/.local/bin/ait` is already installed. You can bootstrap aitasks in any new project directory by simply running:

```bash
cd /path/to/new-project
ait setup
```

The shim detects that no aitasks project exists, downloads the latest release, installs it, and then runs the full setup — all in one command.

**Windows/WSL users:** See the [Windows/WSL Installation Guide](https://beyondeye.github.io/aitasks/docs/installation/windows-wsl/) for step-by-step instructions including WSL setup, Claude Code installation, and terminal configuration.

## What Gets Installed

**Per-project files** (committed to your repo):
