## aitasks

**aitasks** is an AI-powered task management framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview). It provides a complete workflow for capturing, planning, implementing, and archiving development tasks — all driven by Claude Code skills and lightweight CLI tools.

### Key Features

- **Full task lifecycle** — Create, prioritize, implement, review, and archive tasks with structured workflows
- **Claude Code integration** — Slash-command skills (`/aitask-pick`, `/aitask-explore`, `/aitask-create`) that automate planning, implementation, and post-implementation cleanup
- **Kanban board** — Terminal-based TUI board (`ait board`) for visual task management with keyboard-driven navigation
- **Parent-child task hierarchies** — Decompose complex features into subtasks with automatic context propagation between siblings
- **Multi-developer support** — Atomic task locking, unique ID counter, and git-based status tracking for parallel development
- **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket integration** — Import issues, link tasks to issues, and post implementation notes back when done
